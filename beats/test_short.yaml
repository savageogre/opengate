# Number of audio samples per second.
# 48 kHz is standard for high-quality audio and works well with most players.
sample_rate: 48000

# Overall volume multiplier.
# 0.0 = silent, 1.0 = full scale. 
# 0.9 means "90% of max". This keeps the audio strong while leaving headroom to avoid clipping.

# This is a list of segments of the song.
segments:
  # A tone segment is a fixed-frequency carrier with binaural beat offset.
  # It persists this binaural beat for a duration with no changes in phase.
  - type: tone
    # Duration in seconds.
    dur: 3.0
    gain: 0.25
    # Base frequency sent to the left ear.
    carrier: 200.0
    # Beat frequency (it's the difference between the left and right ears).
    # Left ear = carrier frequency (200 Hz)
    # Right ear = carrier + hz (207 Hz)
    # This produces a 7 Hz binaural beat, which is in the theta range.
    hz: 7.0
    # This doesn't need to be specified, but otherwise you can provide optional noise per segment.
    noise:
      # Color options are: pink, white, brown.
      # Default is: pink
      color: pink
      gain: 0.4

  # A gradual glide from one tone to another.
  # This allows "entrainment", the process of nudging the brainâ€™s rhythms to follow an external beat.
  # A transition segment smoothly shifts from one beat frequency to another,
  # helping the brain gradually follow along instead of being jolted to a new frequency.
  # For example, moving from ~7 Hz (theta, relaxed focus) to 3.875 Hz (deep theta or delta) supports easing into a
  # meditative or hypnagogic state.
